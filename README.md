## Team mambers:
* Sunny Patel (100620076)
* Ari Lotter (100621763)
* Samantha Husack (100617713)

## How To Execute
#### A) Galton Board
* Have MATPLOTLIB installed on your computer. (https://matplotlib.org/)
* go to .../data_struct-project/galton/
* Run: ``` python3 render_galton_animation.py ```
* Output will be a series of 6 videos in the present location folder

#### B) Convex Hull
* Have MATPLOTLIB installed on your computer. (https://matplotlib.org/)
* go to .../data_struct-project/
* Run: ``` python3 hull.py ```
* Input number of random points to generate
* Ouput will be a pop-up Graph

#### C) K-Means
* Have MATPLOTLIB installed on your computer. (https://matplotlib.org/)
* go to .../data_struct-project/k-means/
* Run: ``` python3 k-means-GUI.py ```
* Fill GUI information Value of K (#means),
  * If using random data, enter the # of data points, and toggle between 2D and 3D data as appropriate
  * If using CSV data, copy and paste the CSV data in the following format:
> x, y

> p1x, p1y

> p2x, p2y

* Ouput will be a pop-up Graph, and a time measurement in the GUI
